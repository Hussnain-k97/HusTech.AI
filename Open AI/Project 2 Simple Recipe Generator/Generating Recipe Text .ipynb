      "- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n",
      "- 2 cups broccoli florets\n",
      "- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1/4 cup soy sauce\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Heat the olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts and cook for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until they are cooked through and reach an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, or until fragrant. Be careful not to burn it.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Add the broccoli florets to the skillet and stir-fry them for about 3-4 minutes, until they turn bright green and are slightly tender.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Meanwhile, slice the cooked chicken breasts into thin strips and set them aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce and 2 tablespoons of water. Pour this mixture over the broccoli in the skillet and let it cook for an additional minute, allowing the flavors to combine.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Return the sliced chicken to the skillet and toss everything together, making sure the chicken and broccoli are evenly coated in the soy sauce mixture.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is reheated and coated with the sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Remove the skillet from the heat and serve the Garlic Soy Sauce Chicken with Broccoli over steamed rice or noodles. Garnish with chopped green onions or sesame seeds if desired.\n",
      "\n",
