# RECIPE GENERATION USING OPENAI'S GPT-3 AND DALL·E

### Overview

This Python-based project utilizes OpenAI's API for text generation and image prediction. It generates recipes based on user-input ingredients, creates a corresponding recipe title, and predicts an image using DALL·E 3 that matches the generated title.

### Features
Recipe Generation: Users provide ingredients, and the program generates a recipe along with cooking instructions.
### Title Creation: 
The program generates a catchy and relevant recipe title based on the provided ingredients.
Image Prediction: Utilizes DALL·E 3 to predict an image corresponding to the generated recipe title.
