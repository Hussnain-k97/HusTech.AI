# RECIPE GENERATION USING OPENAI'S GPT-3 AND DALL·E

### Overview

This Python-based project utilizes OpenAI's API for text generation and image prediction. It generates recipes based on user-input ingredients, creates a corresponding recipe title, and predicts an image using DALL·E 3 that matches the generated title.

### Features
Recipe Generation: Users provide ingredients, and the program generates a recipe along with cooking instructions.
### Title Creation: 
The program generates a catchy and relevant recipe title based on the provided ingredients.
Image Prediction: Utilizes DALL·E 3 to predict an image corresponding to the generated recipe title.

### Requirements
* Python 3.x
* OpenAI Python library
* DALL·E 3 access

### Installation
    1. Clone this repository.
    2. Install the required Python libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    3. Set up access to DALL·E 3 API and obtain necessary keys or credentials.

### Usage 
    1. Run the Python script.
    2. Input the desired ingredients when prompted.
    3. The program generates a recipe, instructions, and a title.
    4. The title is used to predict an image using DALL·E 3, and the image is displayed within the code or saved locally.
